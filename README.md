# PKPDsimShiny
Create Shiny apps on-the-fly based on ODE simulations with PKPDsim

*Warning: at current, further development and support of PKPDsimShiny has stopped since I do not have the time to keep the code up to date with the underlying PKPDsim library. Although for simple applications this library might still work, and development might be continued in the future, for now I would advise to build your own Shiny app around PKPDsim instead of relying on this library.*
